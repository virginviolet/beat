# beat v01

Author: byuu

Description from the [user manual](https://github.com/virginviolet/beat/blob/main/beat.html):

>beat is a delta-based binary differencing patcher and specification. It encodes the differences between either a) two files, or b) two folders, and stores the difference as a beat patch.
>
>Unlike linear patches, delta patches can detect and encode data insertions and deletions. What this means is that patches against files that have had data inserted or removed from them are substantially smaller.
>
>Patches that encode the difference between two files use the .bps extension, short for "beat patch - single (file)"
>
>Patches that encode the difference between two folders full of files use the .bpm extension, sort for "beat patch - multi (file)"
